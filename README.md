# NLP-Drug-Prediction
The NLP Drug Prediction project utilizes Natural Language Processing to predict the appropriate medication based on patient symptoms and medical history.By analyzing textual data from medical records, such as symptoms descriptions and previous treatments, the model identifies relevant drug options. Techniques like text preprocessing, embedding, and classification algorithms enable the system to understand medical terminology and make informed predictions.This project aims to support healthcare professionals by providing data-driven drug recommendations for improved patient outcomes.
